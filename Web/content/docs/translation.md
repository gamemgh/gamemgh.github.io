To translate, copy the English folder (en) with your own language code. For the most update English version we recommend [downloading from this link](https://github.com/gamemgh/langs/releases/download/lang/en.zip).

Note: Language codes must be always lowercase. You can use upper case for country codes. For example, en-US means en is language code, and US is the country code, so US can be uppercase.

Note 2: config.toml is the file require to provide you and your language information.

## Updated keys
English translations might have new keys or existing keys updated. To view the updated keys ordered by date, visit [updated translation keys page](https://github.com/gamemgh/langs/blob/main/keys.md). If you notice one or more keys are updated, download the English language again from the link given in the first.

If there is a new file added you have to copy that new file. Otherwise, if existing or new keys are updated, you have to look at above link for the list (just remember the last date you downloaded English file). Carefully copy each updated or new keys if the file already exists.

## Config file
Config file has the following keys:

Main keys; these are keys that are directly put at the top of the file:
- `name`(required): Your language full name.

Author keys; the following is a list of keys that must be put in the `author` section:
- `name`(required): Your name or group of names.
- `homepage`(optional: Your website, or contact link, or email. If it is email, start with the prefix `mailto:` before your email. Examples homepage formats:
	- `https://example.com`: Your website.
	- `mailto:example@gmail.com`: Your email.

# Translation Policy{#policy}
We do not verify a full translation because we do not speak every language. This is why the web pages are not translated to insure maximum readability.

When translating, note the following:
- Translations must proceed exactly as written in above documentation.
- Only config.toml is fully subject to Verification, and you  are responsible to keep your language translations up to date. However, this does not mean you can put unnecessary things in the translations. If we receive reports from players about the translation, that language might get removed.
- The languages are deamed outdated and will be removed if they are not updated within 3 months of the latest game release. Notifications will be sent to the channels 2 weeks before their removal.
- Translators are recommended to join to the Telegram channel found in the footer of this website if you have it to get notifications, as many of the notifications are sent there.
- We do not completely prohibit the use of the translation tools, but the manual translations is encouraged over using translation tools to insure accuracy and readability. Thus, manual translations are highly recommended, because players want their language to be as accurate as possible and they expect you to consider the same.
