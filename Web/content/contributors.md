This is the list of contributors who had assisted the game better. Looking for ways to contribute? Remember, even feedbacks and suggestions count in contribution. Check [how to contribute]({{% relref "contribute.md" %}}).

## General
- [Harry Min Khant](https://harrymkt.github.io): Project founder, the core developer.
- [Sam Tupy](https://samtupy.com/): Developer of NVGT (Nonvisual Game Toolkit), the game engine this game is used.
- [GitHub](https://github.com): Website host, for public contributions and to maintain releases, as well as private repository for source code keeping for the purposes of backup and collaborative contributions.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io): A static site generator written in Go, which helped generating this website way easy than having manually writing down much HTML/JS, with the ability to use themes of my own.
- Dao Duc Trung (the owner of [ddt.one](https://ddt.one)): Thanks for giving me the idea to create a game zone, that is, many mini games bundled into 1 game. While the game is initially planned for battle game, this idea brings me into creating something that would not be boring for everyone. In addition, if you want to get useful resources and information, you should probably visit his website.
- Lastly, yet to be listed, thanks everybody who play this game and their suggestions. Without user suggestions and above contributors this game wouldn't have gotten this far.
