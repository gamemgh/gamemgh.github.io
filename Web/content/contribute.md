## Documentation
You can contribute documentation if you have GitHub knowledge.

To contribute, site and/or documentation improvements, visit [this repository](https://github.com/gamemgh/gamemgh.github.io).

## Developer
This game is not an open source and therefore developer acceptance is nearly impossible. For sound contribution, you can send on Telegram directly.
