<li>The beta token field in the settings is now a protected field.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="new-in-version-013-build-20251031">New in version 0.1.3 (build 2025.10.31)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, the translation system has been removed. Check this <a href="https://gamemgh.github.io/blog/translation-system-removal">blog post</a>.</li>
<li>Android now works again!</li>
<li>Changes for RFC mini game; These are changes that have been applied to Run for Your CHOCOLATES mini game and thus it is best to group them into 1 for readability:
<ul>
<li>Added new voices for RFC: &quot;Jazzyjennifer&quot;, &quot;Sneha&quot;, &quot;Angie&quot;.</li>
<li>Chocolate makers in RFC can randomly fly now! They have aircrafts to follow you.</li>
<li>You can now hit chocolate makers! Use your fireballs! Use your <code>Tab</code> and <code>Shift+Tab</code> to navigate your inventory, and <code>Enter</code> to throw. When you kill them, you will get the chocolates they had took. Fireballs will be randomly spawned, but you can find them at your starting coordinate. They also make fire noise.</li>
<li>Chocolate makers now have their own characteristic values. This means that different chocolate makers will move differently, and each of them has different capabilities.</li>
<li>Chocolate makers now have default number of chocolates in their bags upon they are spawned.</li>
<li>You can now press the <code>A</code> key to look nearest chocolate makers that are within 25 meters, along with some information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added check for beta updates icon in the main menu. This icon requires a token, and thus only those who has access to beta can type. The token may change over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-in-version-012-build-20250912">New in version 0.1.2 (build 2025.09.12)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a new mini game called Run for Your CHOCOLATES (RFC). The objective of the game is to collect as much chocolates as possible in a given time. You will move around a 75 by 75 grid, with no jumping capability. Listen carefully for chocolate makers. They have the ability to make you lose your chocolates, or lose the game instantly if you are to step on them. Be warned, that 30 percent of them can also walk to you. Thanks several players (found in documentation of the game) for voice acting as chocolate makers!</li>
<li>Revert the game back to old sound system to resolve game crashing issues. You might experience no sound as of this change. You can change the device in the settings if that is the case. The best thing of the old sound system is the ability to set to default device back, so you do not need to worry about sound device changes. Unfortunate, this disables the Android build. Sorry for Android players, but the game can no longer run on Android. We will be fixing it as soon as possible mainly with the new sound system / plugin loading.</li>
<li>The CHS system that opens with <code>Alt+H</code> now receives a new control called sound overview, which basically displays the sounds that you can listen and learn. This control changes depending on the topic you have selected. You can press <code>F2</code> in the sound overview list to play the selected sound.</li>
<li>Changed menu sounds.</li>
<li>Added a sound when you drink the potion in Endless Battle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-in-version-011-build-20250810">New in version 0.1.1 (build 2025.08.10)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added contextual help system (CHS). Press <code>Alt + H</code> and it will display help. You can also press the shortcuts and listen their info in the keyboard area in realtime. The help topics are english builds. Also, this system is not currently available on Android unless if you are using a keyboard to navigate.</li>
<li>Translation / language improvements:
<ul>
<li>Added an icon in the main menu to check for fallback language updates so that you do not need to change to english every time you want to get updates for translation.</li>
<li>Languages will now automatically refresh if needed.</li>
<li>All previous languages have been converted to be compatible with the new system. Download from the language downloader.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-in-version-010-build-20250705">New in version 0.1.0 (build 2025.07.05)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Warning. After updating, you might lose your data because of a change in data directory retrieving system. This is system dependent. If your data is somehow unavailable, review the path in the settings so you can make necessary corrections, for example moving the files when needed. This is the last adjustment to the data directory. Android devices can now save the game data!</li>
<li>Language translation system has been changed. You can now click an icon in the main menu called &quot;Language Manager&quot;. Due to this, all languages have been cleared and we apoligize for it. This system is good because it makes updating keys easier than before and you can test your translations without leaving the game. After translating you can send to me as before, but this time, 1 file only.</li>
<li>Fixed language downloader detecting languages incorrectly. Thanks &quot;Rafael Brito&quot; for the report.</li>
<li>Added an icon in the main menu to check your current language updates.</li>
<li>You can now set sound input and output devices in the settings (Android excluded).</li>
<li>Improved Settings and other UI dialogs (Android excluded).</li>
<li>You can now select menu music or make it random in the settings (Android excluded). By default, it is set to random.</li>
<li>In Endless Battle, enemies can now wear shields, therefore it is now more difficult to hit them. Also, some of your large enough weapons – like Rifle, Sniper, Grenade – can be randomized whether they will hit the shield or the body of the enemy directly. Since you already have magical abilities, you currently do not have the ability to wear shields.</li>
<li>Readable time days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds can now be translated.</li>
<li>Added download system in the game. Unfortunately Android has not been tested.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-in-version-009-build-20250402">New in version 0.0.9 (build 2025.04.02)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed the name to Multi Games Hoard to resolve copyright name and DMCA issues. This change does not affect players much though, because the website and general short form of the game's name is left untouched. Note: to get your data back, go to appdata folder, then rename the previous game's name folder to MGH, then put it in a folder called HarryMK. You will need to create that folder, or you can also open the game so it will automatically create for you then you can copy the folder and rename it.</li>
<li>Added Statistics Menu to display your statistics. Thanks &quot;Lamar&quot; for the suggestion. The number of available Statistics is currently small but will be expanded in the future.</li>
<li>Added 2 questions when the English language does not exist in the folder. This means that the English folder is not required now, but these questions will be constantly asked every time you run the game. This is a temporary issue to resolve a Mac OS directory checking issue, so it might be taken away in the future, because English should be there to replace the keys that are not translated in your language, either it is outdated or the keys do not exist. There is also an option in the settings to disable this warning, but this option is never translated.
<ol>
<li>Firstly, before asking questions, it will display an alert box warning you about the cause.</li>
<li>Next, it will ask whether or not to open the download page to download the English language.</li>
<li>Finally, it will ask whether or not to continue anyway.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Fixed the bug where you do not get more than 4 times your total points worth of currency in Archery mini game, now you will get up to the maximum of 10 times your total points worth of currency  as documented.</li>
<li>Added a new magic spell called &quot;Trophy Energy&quot; which increases your magic energy faster for seconds. This spell will be able to use in other future magic games as well. How many times faster it will increase your energy as well as how many seconds it will last will be determined by the mini game you play. In Endless Battle, for example, it will increase your magic energy 2 times faster for 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Language Downloader now includes information of each language's name and its author name if available.</li>
<li>Changes for Endless Battle mini game; These are changes that have been applied to Endless Battle mini game and thus it is best to group them into 1 for readability:
<ul>
<li>Enemy voices will now randomize depending on how much voices the enemy has. Thanks &quot;Blue Ken Sunshine&quot; for the suggestion!</li>
<li>Enemies now possess the capacity for mutual combat; they will attack and eliminate each other if within attack range, but do not actively move towards each other to initiate such engagements. You can exploit this by strategically positioning enemies. For example, by moving around a combat area - to the right, then left, then back again - you can manipulate enemy proximity, causing them to attack each other, thus reducing the overall threat. When you think their health is low enough, for instance, you can shoot them once, avoiding 2 bullets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-in-version-008-build-20250315">New in version 0.0.8 (build 2025.03.15)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The game will no longer run if the fallback language (en) cannot be found in the folder.</li>
<li>Translation languages now require config.toml file be present in the root folder of the language. Copy the config.toml from English language (en) and replace with your own configuration values. See the translations documentation first for more information if you are unsure about it.</li>
<li>You can no longer set the same language when choosing in the language selection menu.</li>
<li>Added a menu to download the languages you want! Due to this, only English is added in official game release to prevent increasing size, and go download other languages (if available) if you want to use them. Regardless of what languages you download, you must never delete the English folder or the game will not run as indicated by above change.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-in-version-007-build-20250313">New in version 0.0.7 (build 2025.03.13)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added translation system! This is still in its early development, and all strings might not be available to translate. Translations live in the lang folder, with a subfolder with the language code prefix. To translate the program, copy the main fallback translation folder (en) with your own language prefix. After translations you may send to me.</li>
<li>You can now copy menu items with Control+C, or triple tap with three fingers on Android.</li>
<li>Introducing a new mini game (Archery)! This is a game where you will shoot a flying plane that is moving from side to side. This game fully supports Android gestures. Read more about the game in the documentation section on the website.</li>
<li>Removed auto updating because it may cause some devices with slow internet so that they cannot start the game. Updates are now require manual checks.</li>
<li>Changes for Endless Battle mini game; These are changes that have been applied to Endless Battle mini game and thus it is best to group them into 1 for readability as many changes were made:
<ul>
<li>Removed coordinate checking. You do not need it.</li>
<li>Fixed enemy detection to spawn.</li>
<li>XP for Bear is slightly increased, and all enemies have increased their health.</li>
<li>Introducing a new weapon (Axe)! This weapon is better than Sword as a melee weapon and is available for resurrection 2. This causes the Sword to shorten its range as the Axe takes place on it.</li>
<li>Introducing magic attacks! Press the M key, or double tap with one finger on the top right of the screen on Android, to bring up the magic spells which can be casted if you have enough magic energy. The magic energy can be gained as the enemies are killed, and will not reach over 100. Note that availability of magic spells is based on your resurrection, and in some case, level is also included.</li>
<li>Some weapons damage has been reduced.</li>
<li>Fixed the S key to turn a full 180 degrees.</li>
<li>You can now get coin as an item when you kill an enemy.</li>
<li>Hitting your target with weapon is now harder as you now need to exactly face in the direction. Better listen, use headphones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-in-version-006-build-20250101">New in version 0.0.6 (build 2025.01.01)</h2>
<p>First of all, <strong>Happy new year!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dice Match can now generate below 1 number, in which case you will lose dollar. This is completely randomized anyway. As such, you can now press faster.
<ul>
<li>Dice Match now has buffer support. Note this is only for non Android users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The game will now auto check for updates at startup. You can turn it off in the settings if you want to, but it is recommended to keep it on, as that option can be removed in the future if needed.</li>
<li>Added a checkbox in the settings to control whether item loop sounds are played. Thanks &quot;Way Yan Soe&quot; for his suggestion!</li>
<li>Changes for Endless Battle mini game; These are changes that have been applied to Endless Battle mini game and thus it is best to group them into 1 for readability as many changes were made:
<ul>
<li>Enemies can now spawn base on your map and the number of your resurrection. This means that bigger and bigger enemies will you likely to find as your resurrection goes higher. This acts just like a starting point for an expansive map system that will be available in the near future.</li>
<li>Introducing a new enemy or animal (Lion)! Watch out! This animal is big, and take a lot of damage than previous enemies, with the approximate estimation that you will be killed is two hits. Do not worry newbies, you will only find them at resurrection 4 or above. Suggestion? Well, stay away from them, and shoot from a greater distance. They also have a slight higher range than Bears, which is another thing to care of.</li>
<li>The game now speaks who kills you as soon as you die.</li>
<li>Fixed bullet shoot range.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-in-version-005-build-20241208">New in version 0.0.5 (build 2024.12.08)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the download URL for update.</li>

<li>Added a new weapon (Knife)! This is small and lightweight, doing only a small amount of damage though it is faster than the Sword. You should get this weapon when your resurrection is 1 or above. Now, the Sword range is increased while the Knife has a shorter range.</li>
<li>Added a new enemy (Bear!) Be careful, it does a little higher amount of damage than Wolf.</li>
<li>Require experience point will now randomize.</li>
<li>You can now customize the spawn time of enemy and it is set to 10 seconds by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added buffer! This means that you can review informations that you have missed. For example, alerts and in-game important notifications. You can press left and right brackets to switch between buffers (holding down Shift will move to top or bottom), and you can press the Comma key or Period key to move through the current buffer (holding down Shift will move to top or bottom). Android gestures not supported.</li>
<li>Introducing a new mini-game: Dice Match! The objective is to roll the dice, which contain two numbers, each ranging from 1 to 6. If the two numbers match, you will earn money equal to 0 to 20 times their total. There you go, Android gamers, because this mini game fully supports gestures and thus keyboard is not required!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-in-version-004-build-20241117">New in version 0.0.4 (build 2024.11.17)</h2>
<p>Please note that the Android version still cannot save data.</p>
<ul>

<li>Added items! Now, when an enemy dies, a random item will be spawned at its location which will be picked up if you are close enough with it.</li>
<li>Fixed inventory item speech on Android which causes the item to stop speaking. The positional speak of the inventory item has now been removed.</li>

<ul>

<ul>
<li>In this new mini game, you play blackjack. You can move up and down arrows to navigate through the game's structure. When you gained dollars, you can use them to buy health items, ammos, etc for Endless Battle mini game.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>More Android gestures for Endless Battle: Swipe up with 3 fingers to check ammo, and swipe down with 3 fingers to check coordinates. Wo, near to 4 fingers!</li>
<li>Hopefully fixed screen reading problem on some Android devices by using an alternative screen reading method. Thanks several players for report!</li>
<li>Added Android number field. Uh, of course, this is simulation. Once the field is popped out you can click on the numbers you want to type, and click done button to finish. This is the only way that Android devices can type.</li>
