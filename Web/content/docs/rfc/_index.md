The objective of RFC is to collect as much chocolates as possible in a given time. You will move around a 75 by 75 grid, with no jumping capability. Listen carefully for chocolate makers. They have the ability to make you lose your chocolates, or lose the game instantly if you are to step on them.

Remember, there is 30 percent chance that these chocolate makers would walk as if they are following you.

Chocolate makers are fully voice acted.

## Features
Run for Your CHOCOLATES advertises the following features:
- Gain in-game currency which can be used across all the games to buy and exchange items.
- Randomized time limits, from 1 (one) minute to 5 (five) minutes.
- 80 to 200 times the money worth your total number of collected chocolates.
- Fully Voice Acted Chocolate Makers; See the [Chocolate maker list]({{% relref "voices.md" %}}).
- Headphone is required. Otherwise, it is nearly impossible to hit your target since you may not know if the chocolate or its maker is in front of you.
- Keyboard is not required; Android gestures fully supported.

## Adding a new chocolate maker
If you want to add your voice to the game:
1. Record the following sounds. These sounds can be an mp3 or an ogg file, and better if you zip the contents before sending:
	- A sound for the loop, meaning the sound they make that you can be heard nearby.
	- A sound when you stepped on the chocolate maker.
1. Place all the contents in a folder and zip it.
1. Finally, you can send me.
