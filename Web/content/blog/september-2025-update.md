Hello. I want to share everyone about what's happening as of now.

## Introduction
In this post, I will be talking about things that are happening as of now.

### The game is now available on Itch!
You have heard right! The game is now officially available on Itch, a platform designed for publishing projects of all kinds. Version 0.1.1 was the first version available on Itch.

[View on Itch](https://harrymkt.itch.io/mgh)

This means the following for you:
- You can now comment, review, create community discussion, issue, question, and suggestion posts within the Itch platform if you have an account on itch.io.
- You can now download, donate, rate, get updates, right within the Itch platform. Everyone who has the Itch app can thus easily update the game when a new version of the game is available.
- Our automatic release workflow also works seemlessly with Itch, and thus updates will be the same as though on this website / GitHub.

### New mini game (Run for Your CHOCOLATES)
The objective of the game [RFC]({{% relref "/docs/rfc/_index.md %}}) is to collect as much chocolates as possible in a given time. You will move around a 75 by 75 grid, with no jumping capability. Listen carefully for chocolate makers. They have the ability to make you lose your chocolates, or lose the game instantly if you are to step on them.
