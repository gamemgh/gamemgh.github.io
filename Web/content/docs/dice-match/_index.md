The objective here, is to roll the dice, which contain two numbers, each ranging from 1 to 6. If the two numbers match, you will earn money equal to 0 to 20 times their total. For example, if the numbers are 5 and 5, their total is 5 + 5 = 10. If the multiplier is, say, you got 15 by luck, you will receive 150, which is 15 times the total.

Remember, if you get a bad luck you may lose in-game currency instead of being gained.
