Endless Battle is a 3D shooting game. This is the first game ever available on Multi Games Hoard and is the largest mini game in this collection , because the initial idea is to develop Endless Battle but then got transfered into Multi Games Hoard, with this game being the first to present.

## Features

- Use different weapons to kill enemies. Use Grenades to shot down all, Machineguns to make quick sessions kill, and more.

## Getting Started
### Game Play
When you click the game, it will ask you to select the map you want to play on. For starters, usually main map is the only available options. Select it.

Once the game is loaded:
- Move around the map and wait for enemies to spawn.
- Select the weapon you wish to use, and shoot down approaching enemies. Please view the [shortcuts list]({{% relref "shortcuts.md" %}}) for a list of shortcuts.
- You automatically level up as you killed an enemy.

### Level System
Level system consists of the following stages, ordered by small to large:
- You gain experience points by killing enemies.
- The gained experience points are used to reach to a new level. Each level requires a certain amount of experience points. As you get higher levels, the amount of required experience points required to reach to a new level increases.
- Whenever you reach to level 1000+your current resurrection, your resurrection increases by 1. If you have, for instance, resurrection 5, you need 1005 levels in order to get to resurrection 6.

### Weapons and Magic
Available weapons will entirely depend on your level and resurrection. As such, sword is available for starters, and you gain new weapons as you level up.

The game also offers magic spells. For starters, there are no available spells. As you level up, you will gain more and more spells.
- You need a certain amount of magic energy to be able to cast a spell. The amount of magic energy require is different for each spell.
- Review the shortcuts list for the shortcut that brings the magic spells menu.
