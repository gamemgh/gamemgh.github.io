To translate, download the English file (en). For the most update English version we recommend [downloading from this link](https://github.com/gamemgh/langs/releases/download/lang/en.json) or you can also use the language downloader in the game.

Once the English language is in place – that is – in the lang folder, open the game and click the icon called "Language Manager".

You can also use the GUI directly in the [langs repository](https://github.com/gamemgh/langs) if you want to work with Git.

You can use tab and shift tab to navigate, as this is the dialog.

Next, if you want to edit your language, choose from the list and click edit. Or if your language isn't in the folder, click create to create a new and follow the dialog.

Note: Language codes must be always lowercase. You can use upper case for country codes. For example, en-US means en is language code, and US is the country code, so US can be uppercase.

## Updated keys
English translations might have new keys or existing keys updated. When you click edit on your language, press tab – or Alt+T – to get to the keys list and it will display whether it is changed, updated, or removed. You can use delete key to remove a translation key. If your language contains keys that are not in the main fallback language anymore, they will be automatically removed.

# Translation Policy{#policy}
We do not verify a full translation because we do not speak every language. This is why the web pages are not translated to insure maximum readability.

However, note the following things when translating:
- Translations must proceed exactly as written in above documentation.
- You  are responsible to keep your language translations up to date. However, this does not mean you can put unnecessary things in the translations. If we receive reports from players about the translation, that language might get removed.
- The languages are deamed outdated and will be removed if they are not updated within 3 months of the latest game release. Notifications will be sent to the channels 2 weeks prior to their removal.
- Translators are recommended to join to the Telegram channel found in the footer of this website if you have it to get notifications, as many of the notifications are sent there.
- We do not completely prohibit the use of the translation tools, but the manual translations is encouraged over using translation tools to insure accuracy and readability. Thus, manual translations are highly recommended, because players want their language to be as accurate as possible and they expect you to consider the same.
