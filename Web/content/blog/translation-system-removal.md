Hello everyone. Unfortunately, the translation system of MGH will be removed in the next update. This is a list of reasons why:
- Complexity: The plane JSON system is increasingly adding more overhead to the game, including, but is not limited to: game size, development time cost, and overall performance. Size is not that much issue here however, because we are only using tens of MB, but the development time cost and overall performance is important.
- I observed that the translation system is not of much use here, and we only have 7 languages, or 6 if English is to be excluded.
- This translation system also limits the ability to make the game more dynamic.

I appreciate everyone's contributions, including suggestions and translations during the translation system is active.

By removing it, I may be able to make the game more dynamic, and several features are already planned for RFC (Run for Your CHOCOLATES) mini game.

If I can implement a regular expression based translation system in the future, the translation system would have reimplemented.

Thank you for your attention.
